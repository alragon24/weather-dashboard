# weather-dashboard
description 
In this challenge, the main goal was to create a weather dashboard that allows users to search cities using the OpenWeather API to display the current weather and a five day forecast to the webpage.
For this project specifically, I used CSS framework for thelayout of the page. I tried out a new framework instead of bootstrap.
I did use a standard input box for the city however, I chose to use a Bulma control select for the state and country.
Displaying different menus became active with adding and removing events.
